The biggest threats to ecosystems globally are reported to be habitat loss and climate crisis (23). 
Ecosystem function and threat prioritization is modelled on islands because of their isolation and confined scale. 
The island of Crete, fits that description and has been studied since the 1980’s for the effects of climate crisis. 
Crete is a continental island formed by drastic tectonic changes between Europe and Africa, 
located in the south of Greece.
It is called a “miniature continent” because it features very sharp gradients in ecosystems vegetation, 
climatic parameters while being the fifth biggest mediterranean island. 
It is a european biodiversity hotspot and the two UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, two UNESCO Geoparks and 54 NATURA2000 sites, 
recognise the preservation need of its ecosystems.
