# Soil microbiome sampling
The metagenomic revolution enabled environmental microbial biodiversity 
studies which for the past 20 years, have sampled multiple local and 
large scale regions (e.g. France microbiome, Earth Microbiome). These 
studies indicated that microbes are omnipresent and impact global ecosystem 
processes through their abundance, versatility and biotic interactions 
(i.e. interactomes). Additionally, microbes influence the major nutrient
cycles and ecosystem functions, such as plant and animal productivity. 
Changes in the structure of microbial communities can be indicative of
ecosystem tipping points e.g aridification.

# Island sampling day and replicability

The Island Sampling Day draws inspiration from the Ocean 
Sampling Day that is a consortium that facilitates yearly samplings 
in stations from all around the world. This has great applications 
in monitoring and comprehending the 
complexity of the ocean microbiome and it's drivers.

The Island Sampling Day has been organised in two islands, Moorea 
in the French Polynisia and Crete in Greece. 

# Standards, metadata and curation

These samplings are focused on standards and metadate to demonstrate their value in future samplings
of the microbiome community.
