---

On the 13th of July, 2022, the team from Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) organised the second ISD of Crete.

The same sampling sites and methods were used in order to take a second 
timepoint of the soil microbiome of Crete. In total, 29 participants volunteered
to the project from the HCMR, the Biology Department of the University of Crete and the 
Natural History Museaum of Crete.


Special thanks to the SUPP GEN project of HCMR for covering the expenses of the sampling.
